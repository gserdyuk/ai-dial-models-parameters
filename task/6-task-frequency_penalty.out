The water cycle is how water moves around the Earth in a never-ending loop. It has four main steps:

1. **Evaporation**: The Sun heats up water from oceans, lakes, and rivers, turning it into water vapor (a kind of gas) that rises into the air.

2. **Condensation**: As the water vapor cools down high in the sky, it turns into tiny water droplets, forming clouds.

3. **Precipitation**: When the water droplets in the clouds become heavy, the water falls back to the ground as rain, snow, or hail.

4. **Collection**: The water collects in rivers, lakes, and the ground, eventually flowing back into the oceans, where the cycle begins again.

It's the Earth's way of reusing water, and it happens over and over, keeping water moving, clean, and available.

The water cycle is how water moves around the Earth. It has four main steps:

1. **Evaporation**: The sun warms up water in rivers, lakes, or the ocean, and it turns into water vapor (like steam) and rises into the sky.

2. **Condensation**: In the sky, the water vapor cools down and turns back into tiny drops of water, forming clouds.

3. **Precipitation**: When the clouds get heavy, the water falls back to Earth as rain, snow, or hail.

4. **Collection**: The water flows into rivers, lakes, and oceans, and the cycle starts again.

It keeps happening over and over, helping plants, animals, and people get the water they need!

The water cycle is how water moves around Earth. It has four main steps:

1. **Evaporation**: The Sun heats up rivers, lakes, and oceans, turning the water into vapor (like steam), which rises into the air.
2. **Condensation**: In the sky, the vapor cools down and turns back into tiny droplets of water to form clouds.
3. **Precipitation**: When clouds get too full of droplets, they release it as rain or snow that falls back to Earth.
4. **Collection**: The rain or melted snow goes into rivers, lakes, oceans—or soaks into soil—and then starts all over again.

It’s a never-ending loop!
