================================================== RESPONSE ==================================================
A Large Language Model (LLM) architecture consists of several key components designed to understand and generate human-like text. Below are the primary components:

1. **Embedding Layers**:
   - Maps input tokens (words, subwords, or characters) to dense numerical vectors in a high-dimensional space. These embeddings capture semantic relationships between tokens.

2.
